/// Interface for the VINSS encrypted Offer helper.
///
/// This contract is an application-specific helper invoked through the STRK20
/// Privacy Pool `InvokeExternal` action.
///
/// IMPORTANT PROTOCOL BOUNDARY:
///
/// - InvokeExternal calldata is public on-chain.
/// - VINSS must encrypt all Offer semantics before constructing this calldata.
/// - This helper does not make calldata private.
/// - This helper does not provide participant authorization by itself.
/// - This helper does not make a standalone Offer-only pool transaction valid.
/// - The containing Privacy Pool transaction must independently satisfy the
///   pool's official WriteOnce replay-protection requirement.
///
/// Every Offer lifecycle action is represented as a separate encrypted payload:
///
/// - create offer;
/// - counter offer;
/// - accept offer;
/// - reject offer;
/// - cancel offer;
/// - expire offer;
/// - prepare deal escrow.
///
/// The action kind and negotiation relationships exist only inside ciphertext.
