/// Interface for the VINSS encrypted Private Escrow helper.
///
/// This contract is an application-specific helper invoked through the STRK20
/// Privacy Pool `InvokeExternal` action.
///
/// IMPORTANT PROTOCOL BOUNDARY:
///
/// - InvokeExternal calldata is public on-chain.
/// - VINSS must encrypt all Private Escrow semantics before constructing this calldata.
/// - This helper does not make calldata private.
/// - This helper does not provide participant authorization by itself.
/// - This helper does not make a standalone Private Escrow-only pool transaction valid.
/// - The containing Privacy Pool transaction must independently satisfy the
///   pool's official WriteOnce replay-protection requirement.
///
/// Every Private Escrow lifecycle action is represented as a separate encrypted payload:
///
/// - create private escrow;
/// - funding intent;
/// - accept private escrow;
/// - funding confirmation;
/// - cancel private escrow;
/// - refund private escrow;
/// - dispute and resolution.
///
/// The action kind, participant context, lifecycle relationships, and rekber coordination exist only inside ciphertext.
