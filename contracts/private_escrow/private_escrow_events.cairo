/// - cancel;
/// - expire;
/// - escrow coordination.

/// All Private Escrow semantics remain inside the encrypted payload.

/// Public metadata that remains visible:
///
/// - the Private Escrow Helper contract was invoked;
/// - one encrypted payload was stored;
/// - its one-time locator;
/// - its payload commitment;
/// - transaction and block timing.
///
/// The ciphertext itself is stored in contract storage and retrieved through
/// the helper getter functions rather than duplicated in this event.
